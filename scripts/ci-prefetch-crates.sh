# Pre-populate the nix store with crates.io tarballs that nixpkgs' fetchurl
# can't download. crates.io's anti-bot layer returns HTTP 403 for requests
# carrying a `curl/*` User-Agent — the default for nixpkgs fetchurl — which
# blocks every `crate-*.tar.gz` fixed-output derivation in this project's cargo
# vendor closure. Measured 2026-08-27:
#
#     curl -A 'curl/8.5.0'  .../crates/cucumber/0.23.0/download  -> 403
#     curl -A 'Mozilla/5.0' .../crates/cucumber/0.23.0/download  -> 200
#
# `NIX_CURL_FLAGS` is listed in fetchurl's `impureEnvVars`, but it is read from
# the BUILD DAEMON's environment, so neither exporting it nor `--option
# impure-env` reaches the builder on a daemon install. Both were tried; both
# still 403.
#
# Workaround: fetch each missing crate with a non-curl UA, then inject the
# tarball into the local store with `nix-store --add-fixed sha256`. That yields
# a content-addressed path identical to the FOD's declared `outputHash`, so the
# subsequent `nix build` finds the artifact already realised and never touches
# the network for it.
#
# Idempotent: crates whose output is already valid in the store are skipped, so
# a warm store (or a populated substituter) makes this a few metadata lookups.
#
# Drop this script and its CI step once upstream nixpkgs sidesteps the UA
# filter (e.g. by fetching from `static.crates.io` directly).
#
# The Rust here is bun2nix itself: `ci::bun-nix-fresh` and
# `just regenerate-bun-nix` both `nix run .#bun2nix`, and on a runner whose
# store lacks it that means building askama / basic-toml / jsonc-parser and
# friends from crates.io. So that is the attribute walked.
#
# Shared, not duplicated by accident: juspay/drishti has carried this for its
# own bun2nix closure since 2026-05 and juspay/osfacts took it for a cargo
# package closure. This copy fixes two things the drishti original has: each
# download URL comes from the derivation's own `urls` attribute rather than
# being rebuilt from the store basename (rebuilding does not survive cargo's
# `+build` metadata), and the crate list is read from a file instead of piped
# into `while read`, so a failed fetch fails the recipe rather than exiting 0
# half-done.
