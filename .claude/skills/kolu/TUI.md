# kolu/TUI — the CLI fallback (`kaval-tui` / `padi-tui`)

**This is the FALLBACK path** — reach for it only when the kolu MCP tools
(SKILL.md's primary path) are unavailable: no `kolu mcp` configured on this
host, an older kolu without the MCP face, a non-MCP agent runtime, or a RAW
standalone-kaval terminal padi doesn't track. The discipline is identical to
the MCP path (three-step submit, observe-then-act, timeouts on every wait) —
only the spelling changes. The whole toolkit is **`kaval-tui`** — write input,
read the screen, spawn, kill — plus **`padi-tui`** for agent-state waits and
worktree provisioning; the driver runs them directly.

For a raw `kaval-tui`-spawned terminal, the done-signal is **`kaval-tui wait
--until idle:<ms>`** — it blocks in the daemon on the raw PTY output and returns
the moment the agent stops streaming, with no shell hooks (below). `padi-tui`
adds a *precise agent-state* done-signal (`wait --until <buckets>`), but only for
terminals a **kolu owns** (the last section); for raw terminals, reach for
`kaval-tui wait`.

## The loop

```sh
id=$(kaval-tui create --json -- claude | jq -r .id)            # spawn the inner agent
kaval-tui send  "$id" "refactor the parser to use a lexer"     # 1. the text (no Enter)
kaval-tui wait  "$id" --until idle:300 --timeout 15000         # 2. observe the TUI settle
kaval-tui send  "$id" --key Enter                              # 3. submit (its own command)
kaval-tui wait  "$id" --until idle:800 --timeout 600000        # 4. let its turn finish (below)
kaval-tui snapshot "$id" --viewport                            # 5. read the screen
```

Leaf commands, all `kaval-tui`: **create** (spawn) · **send** (write text, OR a
`--key`) · **wait** (block until output settles) · **snapshot** (read) · **kill**.
Submitting a prompt is its **own** `send --key Enter`, sent *after* you observe
the TUI settle — never folded into the text send. Why: a same-breath Enter races
the TUI's paste debounce and is silently dropped. See the next section.

> **Read with `snapshot --viewport`, not `| tail`.** A bare `snapshot` prints the
> **whole scrollback** — thousands of lines on a long-running or compacted agent —

> when you want a fixed slice.

## `kaval-tui send` — the canonical three-step submit

Submitting a **normal-size** prompt to a TUI agent is **three commands**, because
`send` bakes in no timing magic — it writes exactly what you pass and nothing more:

```sh
kaval-tui send "$id" "fix the failing test in parser.ts"   # 1. the text (no Enter)
kaval-tui wait "$id" --until idle:300 --timeout 15000      # 2. OBSERVE the TUI settle — a signal, not a sleep (bounded: exit 2 = target busy, send Enter anyway)
kaval-tui send "$id" --key Enter                            # 3. submit
```

Why not one command? An Enter sent in the *same breath* as the text races Claude
Code's bracketed-paste / debounced input handling and is **silently dropped**,
leaving the prompt staged on the `❯` line while `send` reports success (if a turn
never seems to start, this is the #1 cause — `snapshot` and look for the prompt
sitting unsent). `kaval` **cannot observe** when the TUI settled, so any fixed
grace baked into `send` is a race you tune until it stops biting on your machine
and starts again on a slower one. The honest fix is step 2: **you**, the caller,
observe the settle with `wait --until idle:<ms>` (no output for `<ms>` — see the
done-signal section), then submit as its own command. `send "$id" "text" --key
Enter` in one call is a **hard error** for exactly this reason — the trap is
unspellable, not merely discouraged.

Specifics:

- **Multiline text, `--file`, and piped stdin go as one bracketed paste**, so
  they land in the input box as a block instead of submitting line-by-line.
  Automatic (`--paste` / `--no-paste` force it).
- **`--key <name>`** (repeatable) is the control channel: `Escape`, `C-c`,
  `Enter`, `Up`/`Down`/`Left`/`Right`, `Tab`, `Home`, `End`, `Backspace`,
  `M-<char>`. `--key Enter` is how you submit (step 3). A send carries **text OR
  keys, never both** — the mix is rejected.
- **Bounded write.** A `send` whose write can't complete (the target isn't
  draining its input — e.g. a program that stopped reading stdin) **fails loud in
  seconds**, naming the stalled terminal, instead of hanging forever.
- **`--json`** → `{ id, bytes, paste, keys }` to confirm what was written.

**`send` is blind** — it writes whether or not the agent is ready for input.
Always pair it with `snapshot` so you don't fire a prompt into a not-yet-ready
session (e.g. before the TUI has drawn its input box, or over a trust prompt).

**Interrupt a runaway** before redirecting it:

```sh
kaval-tui send "$id" --key Escape          # stop Claude Code mid-stream
kaval-tui send "$id" --key C-c             # SIGINT whatever's running
```

## The done-signal — `kaval-tui wait --until idle:<ms>`

After you submit, you need to know when the turn ends. For a raw
`kaval-tui`-spawned terminal there's no agent-state feed — but the daemon already
sees every output byte, so **`kaval-tui wait`** blocks on that raw stream and
returns the instant the agent goes quiet, with **no shell hooks** and no
busy-word guessing:

```sh
kaval-tui wait "$id" --until idle:800 --timeout 600000   # block until the turn ends
```

- **`--until idle:<ms>`** resolves once no output byte has arrived for `<ms>` —
  the agent-agnostic "turn ended / awaiting input" signal, and the common case.
  `800` is a good default; raise it for an agent that pauses mid-thought, lower
  it for a snappier loop. It works identically for `claude`/`codex`/`grok`/
  `opencode` because it keys on bytes, not on any agent's rendering.
- **`--until match:'<regex>'`** resolves once *new* output matches — use it for a
  completion marker or a returned-prompt sentinel (e.g. `--until match:'\$ $'`).
- **`--timeout <ms>`** caps the wait and **fails loud (exit 2)** so a wedged agent
  can't hang the loop. If the terminal **exits** before the condition fires,
  `wait` exits **3** (the agent you were driving died). Met → exit **0**.

- **`--json`** → one result frame per outcome: `{ id, result, … }`, where
  `result` is `met`/`timeout`/`gone`/`interrupted`/`closed`. A `met` frame adds
  `fired` (`idle`/`match`), `elapsedMs`, and `matchedLine` on a match — so a
  driver reads the structured `result`, never just the exit code.

Quiescence ≠ "the reply is correct": idle fires whether the agent **finished** or
is **blocked asking you something** (both mean "your move"). So after `wait`
returns, **`snapshot --viewport` and read** what's on screen before responding.

When the terminal should be a **kolu-owned** workspace — visible on the canvas,
tracked by padi's agent sensors so `padi-tui wait` works against it — provision
it with `padi-tui create` instead of raw `kaval-tui create`:

```sh
git -C /abs/path/to/repo pull --ff-only     # the worktree is cut from the repo's CURRENT checkout
padi-tui create --repo /abs/path/to/repo --worktree my-branch -- <agent> <mode-flags>
# e.g. `-- claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` — prints the new terminal's id; padi owns it
```

> **A split tile BESIDE you — `--parent "$KAVAL_TERMINAL_ID"`.** When you want the
> new terminal to open as a **split beside your own** (a sibling tile on the same
> canvas — e.g. driving a selected Claude/Codex/Grok peer per `/agent-debate`), pass
> **`--parent <your-terminal-id>`**, using your self-knowledge var
> `$KAVAL_TERMINAL_ID` (see *Reach*): `padi-tui create --parent "$KAVAL_TERMINAL_ID"
> -- <selected-agent> <unrestricted-flags> …`. Add `--worktree`/`--repo` too if the split should also get its

> NOT a split** — it spawns a *detached, standalone* terminal that isn't a tile
> beside you, isn't on the canvas, and isn't padi-tracked. So whenever the intent is
> "a split next to me", reach for `padi-tui create --parent`, never raw `kaval-tui
> create`.

- **Never hardcode the agent CLI.** `<agent>` defaults to the same agent *you*
  are running as (a Claude Code orchestrator spawns `claude`, a codex one
  `codex`, …) — unless the human named a different agent in their prompt, which
  wins.
- **Fast-forward the base repo first.** `--worktree` branches from the repo's
  checkout as it stands — a stale default branch silently seeds the agent an old
  tree, and nothing errors.
- **`create` returning ≠ the agent is ready.** Snapshot before dispatching: a
  fresh worktree's first dev-env build can take minutes, and a first-run agent
  may sit on a one-time dialog (MCP server selection, a trust prompt) that needs
  its own `send --key Enter`. Drive every boot step by `snapshot`, never by
  sleeping and hoping.
- **Set the permission mode AT LAUNCH, then verify it from the footer.** An
  agent that will run unattended launches with **bypass permissions**, and the
  mode is a launch flag, not an interactive chore:
  `-- claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` (Claude Code; other agent CLIs
  have their own equivalents). Snapshot the footer and confirm it reads
  `bypass permissions on` before dispatching — auto mode still stops to ask on
  some tool calls, and an unattended agent's question in its own PTY sits
  unanswered. Interactive cycling (`send --key Shift-Tab`, re-snapshot after
  each press) is the fallback for an agent that is already running — never the
  provisioning path.
- **Restarting the agent CLI in place:** text typed at a *running* agent becomes
  a prompt (your relaunch command line gets answered, not executed), and `C-c`
  doesn't reliably quit the TUI — send the agent's quit command (`/exit` in
  Claude Code) as its own three-step submit, wait for the shell prompt to show
  in the snapshot, then launch again.

## `padi-tui wait` vs `kaval-tui wait` — two done-signals

They are not rivals; they read different things:

- **`kaval-tui wait`** keys on **raw output quiescence/match** — works on **any**
  terminal, **no hooks**. This is the one to reach for when driving a raw
  `kaval-tui create` agent (above). It can't tell "finished" from "blocked asking
  you" — both are quiescence — so read the snapshot after.
- **`padi-tui wait`** keys on **agent-state buckets** (working/awaiting/waiting)
  — more precise (it *distinguishes* awaiting-you from finished), but only for
  terminals a **kolu owns** (padi runs the agent sensors over them). Use it when
  you're driving terminals a kolu-server spawned (below).

### `padi-tui wait` — the precise done-signal (kolu-owned terminals only)

When you *do* have agent-state detection, `padi-tui wait <id> --until <buckets>`
is the exact done-signal — it blocks until the agent reaches a coarse state, then
exits 0:

- **`working`** — busy (`thinking` / `tool_use` / background task).
- **`awaiting`** — `awaiting_user`: it's **asking you** a question.
- **`waiting`** — the **just-finished** post-turn lull.

`awaiting` and `waiting` both mean "your move", so `--until awaiting,waiting`
catches a turn ending; `--timeout <ms>` fails loud (exit 2) so a wedged agent
can't hang the loop; if the terminal **exits** before reaching the state, `wait`
fails loud too (exit 3 — the agent you were driving died); `--json` →
`{ id, agent }`.

> ```

## Reach — which daemon you're driving

**Lead with `kaval-tui list`.** With no `--socket`, it autodiscovers every
running daemon on this machine and prints each with a human label — `kolu-server
on port 7692`, `standalone kaval` — so you pick the right one without knowing any
path. This is the cross-platform, self-labeling answer to "which daemon am I
driving", and the reliable path on macOS (where `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset). If
exactly one daemon is up, every command autodiscovers it — no flag needed.

**Inside a kolu terminal, `$KAVAL_SOCKET` already names your daemon.** Every
terminal a kolu-server (or `kaval-tui create`) spawns exports `$KAVAL_SOCKET` —
the socket of the kaval that owns *this* terminal (the `$TMUX` convention). So an
agent driving its **sibling** terminals can skip discovery and point straight at
it: `kaval-tui list --socket "$KAVAL_SOCKET"`, `kaval-tui snapshot <id> --socket
"$KAVAL_SOCKET"`. It's the one unambiguous answer when several daemons are up
(autodiscovery would return "many"). Absent → you're not inside a kolu PTY, so
fall back to `kaval-tui list`.

**`$KAVAL_TERMINAL_ID` names *this* terminal.** Its self-knowledge twin: every
kolu terminal also exports `$KAVAL_TERMINAL_ID` — the id of the terminal the agent
is running in. So an agent can act on **itself** without being told which tile it
is: `kaval-tui snapshot "$KAVAL_TERMINAL_ID" --socket "$KAVAL_SOCKET"` reads its
own screen, `padi-tui wait "$KAVAL_TERMINAL_ID" --until …` blocks on its own state.
Re-owned for nested terminals (a kolu spawned inside a kolu terminal stamps its
*own* id over the inherited one), so it's always *this* terminal, never the outer.
Empty → fall back to `kaval-tui list` for the id: you're either not inside a
kolu-spawned PTY, or in one that predates this var and hasn't been respawned yet
(a fresh terminal — or sleep/wake — stamps it).

Two ways to point at a specific daemon instead of autodiscovering:

- **`--socket <path>`** targets one local daemon — e.g. a running **kolu-server's**
  kaval, to drive the terminals you have open in kolu (these are tracked by that
  kolu's **padi**, so `padi-tui wait` works against them). **Don't hand-construct
  the path** — the rendezvous is an internal, digest-keyed detail (padi owns its
  kaval under a state-root-digest namespace, `kaval-<digest>/pty-host.sock`, not a
  fixed or port-named path). Get the path from **`kaval-tui list`** (it prints
  each running daemon's socket with a human label) or, inside a kolu terminal,
  from **`$KAVAL_SOCKET`** (the daemon that owns *this* terminal). Those are the
  only two reliable sources; a hardcoded guess goes stale the moment the
  namespacing changes.

  > **Socket paths must stay under 108 bytes (the `AF_UNIX` limit).** If you spin
  > up your *own* standalone kaval to verify (no kolu running), keep `--socket`
  > short — `/tmp/kv.$$/pty.sock`, **not** a socket under your agent scratchpad.
  > The scratchpad prefix alone already sits at the 108-byte cap, so a socket
  > there overflows and the daemon fails to bind. The autodiscovered paths above
  > are short by construction; this only bites a hand-rolled `--socket`.
- **`--host <ssh>`** reaches a daemon on another machine (provisioned with Nix);
  a remote PTY survives the link.

## Acceptance

Before calling a driven turn done:

- You **submitted with a separate `send --key Enter`**, sent *after* you observed
  the TUI settle (`wait --until idle`) — never `send "text" --key Enter` in one
  call (it's a hard error), whose Enter races the paste debounce. A prompt left
  staged on the `❯` line is the #1 failure here; the observe-then-submit split is
  what removes the race.
- The inner agent's **reply is actually in the `snapshot`** — not an empty box or
  a half-rendered stream. `wait --until idle` means "output stopped", not "the
  answer is right"; verify the content.
- Your wait had a **`--timeout`** (or deadline) so a wedged agent fails loud
  (exit 2) instead of hanging the loop.
- If the screen settled on a **question** (the agent is awaiting you), you **read
  it and answered** — you didn't send the next task on top of a blocked prompt.
