description: 'Run an automated debate with a live Claude, Codex, or Grok peer until consensus — no round cap, no deadlock exit. Two explicit subcommands: `review` has the selected peer critique the current diff while the invoking agent fixes or disputes findings, committing the trail and optionally posting it to the PR; `answer` has both agents independently answer a prompt, cross-check, and return one confirmed answer. The peer runs in a split terminal driven through /kolu. Use when the user types `/agent-debate`, asks Claude/Codex/Grok to review a change, asks two agents to argue until they agree, or wants a consensus answer from two agents.'

# Agent debate

Debate a selected **Claude, Codex, or Grok peer** until consensus, with **no
round cap and no deadlock exit**. Require both an explicit mode and an explicit
peer: never infer a mutating review from prose, and never silently prefer one
agent over the others.

- **`review`** — the selected peer reviews the current diff; **you** (the author)
  fix or dispute each finding until both sides agree. Commit each author round
  and optionally post the compact trail to the PR.
- **`answer`** — you and the selected peer independently answer a prompt,
  cross-check, and return one confirmed answer. This mode is read-only and
  saves a transcript.

## The engine — a live peer in a split terminal beside you

Drive the debate from your own turn: spawn the selected peer as a **live split
terminal beside you** and take turns until consensus. There is no `Workflow`
tool and no subagent — you are one debater, the split session is the other.
**All terminal mechanics belong to the [/kolu skill](../../../apm_modules/juspay/kolu/agents/.apm/skills/kolu/SKILL.md)**:
split provisioning, send→settle→submit, done-signals, large-paste files, re-key
recovery, and teardown. Read it first; this skill adds only the debate protocol.

Require a kolu terminal so you can spawn a sibling split. If the current session
is not in kolu, say the skill cannot run and stop.

### Select and launch the peer

Parse the required `--agent <claude|codex|grok>` into `PEER` before doing any
work. Reject a missing or unknown value rather than defaulting.

**Never pass a reasoning-effort flag.** Each peer runs at its own CLI default —
the level its vendor ships as right for the model. Pinning one here meant
tracking three different flag spellings and every vendor's supported levels, and
guessing at a tier from outside the tool that knows best.

Use the selected peer's exact preflight and interactive launch:

| `PEER` | Preflight | Split command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | `claude auth status` | `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` |
| `codex` | `codex login status` | `codex --yolo --cd "$REPO"` |
| `grok` | `grok models` | `grok --always-approve --cwd "$REPO"` |

Run Claude from a split whose cwd is already `$REPO`; its CLI has no cwd flag.
If preflight reports an authentication failure, name the matching login command
(`claude auth login`, `codex login`, or `grok login`) and stop. For any other
failure — including network/model discovery failure from `grok models` — surface
the exact error and stop. Do not mislabel it as auth trouble or try another agent.

Provision the peer as a **split tile parented to your own terminal**, never as a
detached terminal. Use /kolu's split-with-parent create
(`lifecycle_create` with `parentId` first; `padi-tui create --parent` only as
its documented fallback). The unrestricted flag is **required**: the peer must
write its verdict file and ping the author's unix socket, so a sandboxed session
cannot run this protocol.

**Boot-check the chosen TUI.** `create` returning does not mean the peer is
ready. Snapshot the split and confirm the selected TUI is at its input prompt in
unrestricted mode (`YOLO mode` for Codex; bypass-permissions/always-approve for
Claude/Grok). A launch may update and fall back to a shell; never dispatch until
the expected TUI is visible.

**Keep both terminal references restart-safe and unambiguous.** Create a
per-run label such as `agent-debate:<timestamp>-<pid>`. On the MCP path, read
your author record from the `terminals` resource. Record its current id and a
unique restart-safe recovery key: prefer a non-empty unique `intent`; otherwise
use the exact `(agent.sessionId, cwd)` pair when both fields exist and identify
one terminal. Stop only when no available key identifies exactly one terminal.
Create the peer with unique intent `<run-label>:<peer>` and record its id plus
that intent. If `send` or `snapshot` reports "no terminal matching", list the
resource and re-resolve the author by its recorded recovery key or the peer by
exact intent, requiring one match. On the CLI fallback, apply the same one-match
rule to stable titles; if either side lacks a unique title, stop rather than
guess. Put the author id plus its recovery key in every peer ask.

Keep one warm peer session for the whole debate. Round 1 receives the full ask;
later rounds receive lean follow-ups and rely on the session's context.

**Make the reverse ping executable.** Put this exact protocol in every ask: after
writing and validating its output file, the peer calls kolu
`lifecycle_sendInput` on the author terminal with text
`AGENT-DEBATE <run-label> VERDICT-WRITTEN <round>`, waits for that terminal with
`wait_outputSettled { idleMs: 250, timeoutMs: 10000 }`, then calls
`lifecycle_sendInput` again with `key: "Enter"`. If the author id is stale, list
terminals, require exactly one match for the recorded author recovery key, and
use its new id. This full text→settle→Enter sequence avoids the dropped-submit
race; the per-run payload cannot be confused for an ordinary prompt.

**Exchange files, not rendered screen text.** Write each round's instructions to
`$REPO/.agent-debate/ask-NNN.md` and send only a short pointer to that file.
Never paste the diff or a rebuttal. Require the peer to write its structured
result to disk, print `VERDICT-WRITTEN`, then ping the author terminal. Read the
file byte-for-byte. If it is missing or malformed, ask the peer to rewrite it;
never infer a verdict from the TUI.

**Tear down only the split you spawned.** Re-resolve its recorded title after a
kaval re-key if needed. Never use a pattern kill (`pkill -f`, `pgrep`,
`ps | grep | kill`, or any marker/substring match). Report unrelated agent
processes by pid and args; never hunt them.

## The core loop — symmetric pings to consensus

End each side's turn by pinging the other terminal:

```text
author → send peer the round ask (file + pointer)      → END TURN
peer   → inspect, write verdict, ping author           → end turn
author → read, fix/dispute, write section, commit      → ping peer → END TURN
 … until the peer verdict is approved
```

Treat the incoming ping as the primary done-signal. The verdict is durable
because the peer writes it before pinging. A lost ping can still stall an ended
turn, so whenever you wake without a fresh ping, perform one bounded
`wait --until match:'VERDICT-WRITTEN'`/snapshot per /kolu and read the file. If
the environment cannot re-invoke you, keep that bounded wait alive instead of
ending the turn. The debate ends only on consensus.

Run autonomously like `/be-review`: make the author-side fix/dispute decisions
without asking the human between rounds. If an orchestrator is driving you,
escalate a genuinely human decision through its reporting channel; otherwise
decide and continue.

## Parse the mode

Inspect the first whitespace-delimited token of `$ARGUMENTS`:

- `review` → read [`REVIEW.md`](REVIEW.md) and follow it.
- `answer` → read [`ANSWER.md`](ANSWER.md) and follow it.
- Anything else, including no arguments → ask for the explicit mode and
  `--agent <claude|codex|grok>`, then stop.

For either mode, reject a missing `--agent`. Never add a bare review alias:
`/agent-debate` deliberately does not encode or default its peer.


Read only the mode you're running — they share this engine and nothing else.

## Files

Keep all ephemeral state in the gitignored per-worktree `.agent-debate/` and
clear it at the start of every run:

- review mode: `ask-NNN.md`, `verdict-NNN.json`, `section-NNN-author.md`
- answer mode: `answer-author-N.md`, `answer-peer-N.md`, `answer-verdict-N.json`,
  `candidate-author-N.json`, `candidate.md`, `answer-<slug>.md`
- both: `comment.md`

None of the scratch feeds a PR comment except the compact generated
`comment.md`. There are no workflow or headless-agent scripts; the engine is
this protocol plus [/kolu](../../../apm_modules/juspay/kolu/agents/.apm/skills/kolu/SKILL.md).

This skill is generated from `agents/.apm/skills/agent-debate/`; edit the source
there and keep generated `.claude/` and `.agents/` copies identical in the same
commit (see `.claude/rules/apm-workflow.md`).
