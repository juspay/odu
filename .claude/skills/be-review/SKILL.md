# Review gauntlet (serial)

Run four reviewers **one after another** on the live branch, each the **sole
editor while it runs**. Collisions are an *edit* problem: two reviewers writing
the same worktree at once see torn, half-edited state. Running serially makes
that impossible without any snapshot machinery — when a step starts, the previous
step has already committed, so every reviewer reads a clean, settled tree and
applies its own fixes directly:

1. **architecture-first-principles** — FIRST, for a diff touching framework packages
   (`@kolu/surface*`), adding/reshaping module structure, **or whose correctness
   rests on a concurrency / ordering claim** (a race declared closed, one event
   asserted to land "before" another, timing across independent async cascades, a
   flag flipped by one callback that another path reads back as truth): run the
   named checks per their SKILL (Workflow fan-out, adversarial verify, scope = diff +
   one hop down its imports). It runs before the lenses so architecture-level
   findings (wrong library, wrong layer, dead API surface) are fixed BEFORE the
   structural/code debates polish details that were about to change shape. Skip
   ONLY for pure-docs or trivially-local diffs — and a diff is **not**
   trivially-local when its correctness leans on a happens-before: P3
   (state-and-time) is the only lens that interrogates an ordering claim, so a
   leaf-module race-fix that skips it is exactly how an untrue "race-safe /
   structural" comment ships past a green gauntlet. Say so either way. Its confirmed
   findings are dispositioned like any stage's — fix now or record where, never
   "acceptable for scope".
2. **`/lens-debate`** — lowy + hickey debate boundaries/simplicity to consensus,
   then **apply** the agreed fixes (each its own commit). Pass the change
   **`rationale`** so the lenses don't flag deliberate decisions.
3. **`/codex-debate`** — codex (`xhigh`) ⇄ claude author, debating to consensus.
   Its author rounds edit and each round auto-commits `fix(…)` on the branch.
4. **`/simplify`** — the self-applying reuse / simplification / efficiency pass
   over the changed code. Now that nothing runs concurrently, it runs as itself
   (it could not against the old read-only snapshot).
5. **code-police** — its rule-checklist and fact-check passes, applying their
   fixes. Run with `--no-elegance` so its elegance pass is skipped: that pass
   re-invokes `/simplify`, which step 4 already ran over this same tree.

Each step runs to completion before the next begins. Wall-clock is
`checks + lens + codex + simplify + police` — slower than the old parallel form, but with
no snapshot, no change-request handoff, and no separate apply pass: every step is
its own editor and commits its own work.

**PR comments come after the push, never before.** Each step commits locally but
be-review pushes only once, after all selected steps finish. A comment that names
a commit SHA must never be posted while that SHA is local-only — if a later step
failed or the run were interrupted, the PR would advertise commits that were
never pushed. So the debate skills run with their self-commenting **suppressed**
(`--no-comment`); be-review captures each comment body (the lens skill returns one
ready; the codex body it assembles as a compact commit table from the debate's own
commits — step 2), pushes once at the end, and only then posts the lens comment, the codex
comment, and its own police summary. No PR comment can reference a local-only
commit.

## Preflight

- **Non-empty diff.** `git diff --stat <base>` (default: the repo default via
  `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`). If empty, stop.
- **Commit first.** Reviewers review *committed* code — commit/stash any
  outstanding work before starting (in `/be` this is automatic: §2/§3 commit and
  push before §4).
- **Resolve the scope once.** `git fetch origin`, then
  `MB=$(git merge-base <base> HEAD)` and `START=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`. Pass `MB`
  as the `base` to every step (their own merge-base resolution is idempotent on a
  SHA) so each reviews the change against the identical fork point. Note that each
  step sees the *commits the previous step added* as part of the diff — that is
  intended: a later reviewer reviews the earlier reviewer's fixes too. Run every
  `git` here with `git -C "$repoPath"` (below) so a cross-repo run resolves the
  *target* repo's base, not the cwd's.
- **Pin `repoPath` — the repo under review may NOT be the cwd.** A `/be` run can
  carry the work in a *companion repo* (e.g. the drishti PR a `@kolu/surface`
  change requires per `/be` §5) while the session is rooted in a kolu worktree.
  Set `repoPath` to that target repo's absolute path (default: the cwd worktree
  root) and thread it into **every** step. Pass `args` as a real object —
  `Workflow({ scriptPath, args: { repoPath, base: MB, … } })`. **Note the harness
  JSON-ENCODES `args` before the workflow script sees it, so `args` arrives as a
  *string* regardless of what you pass.** The debate scripts now parse a stringified
  `args` defensively (`const a = typeof args === 'string' ? JSON.parse(args) : args`),
  so `repoPath`/`base`/`rationale`/`context` thread through correctly and malformed
  `args` throws *loudly* instead of degrading. This fixed a real cross-repo failure: an
  earlier run's scripts did the bare `const a = args || {}`, so the stringified `args`
  had no `.repoPath`, `repoPath` silently degraded to `.`, and a cross-repo lens-debate
  re-reviewed the **cwd** repo and committed five fixes onto the wrong repo (same-repo
  runs only "worked" by cwd coincidence). If a cross-repo step still returns `clean`
  with `rounds: 0` against a non-empty *target* diff, suspect the `repoPath` didn't
  take effect before trusting it.
- **codex login** (unless `--tracks` excludes it): `codex login status`. If not
  logged in, tell the user to run `codex login` (suggest the `!` prefix) and
  continue with the remaining steps.

## Run the steps in order

`--tracks checks,lens,codex,simplify,police` selects which steps run (default all four),
in the listed order. Run each to completion, then move to the next. Preflight
already ran `git fetch origin` and resolved the base, so pass `MB` straight into
each step and **skip the per-skill step-1 fetch / base resolution** — don't redo
it once per step.

**How the debate steps run — two different shapes.** `/lens-debate` runs as a
backgrounded `Workflow` ("launched in background; Task ID: …") that can take
20–30 min; when it settles it fires a task-notification that resumes this run —
that *is* the wait, so after dispatching it go to rest, **don't schedule redundant
`ScheduleWakeup` polls**, and don't babysit (a prior run wired 4-min wakeups *and*
a 5-min `/loop` to nudge a gauntlet that was simply mid-debate — pure churn).
`/codex-debate` is **different now**: it runs **inline in your own turn**, driving
a live codex split terminal that pings you each round — you follow its event-driven
loop to consensus directly, with no background `Workflow` to await. Either way, act
only on the real signal (the lens notification, or codex's ping), never a timer.

1. **lens** — follow `/lens-debate` (Skill tool). `repoPath` = the live worktree,
   `base` = `MB`, **apply mode** (the default — do *not* pass `--no-apply`),
   **`--no-comment`** (so it doesn't advertise its local-only commits before
   be-review pushes — defer the comment until after the push), and thread the
   `rationale` through. It applies the agreed fixes as commits and **returns** its
   rendered comment body for be-review to post after the push. Wait for its
   `Workflow` to finish before starting the codex step.

   `/lens-debate` returns a `status` of `clean`, `consensus`,
   `apply-incomplete`, `unresolved`, or `merge-base-error`:
   - `clean` / `consensus` — the lenses agreed per-finding and applied the fixes.
   - `apply-incomplete` — the lenses agreed, but the Apply phase didn't land every
     fix cleanly (see `applyGaps`: a fix was missing from the apply output or
     changed-but-uncommitted). **Reconcile before moving on:** for each gap, apply
     or commit the outstanding fix yourself (staging only its files), then fold the
     reconciliation into the deferred lens comment. Never report "lens consensus"
     for an `apply-incomplete` run.
   - `unresolved` — the debate hit its round backstop with findings still
     contested. `/be` §4 requires you to **adjudicate every unresolved lens
     finding yourself before moving on**: surface them in the report, decide drop
     or apply for each, and apply the survivors before continuing. Fold your
     adjudication into the deferred lens comment you post after the push (the lens
     skill ran `--no-comment`, so there is no self-posted comment to follow up
     on). Never report "lens consensus" for an `unresolved` run.
   - `merge-base-error` — the scope couldn't be trusted; report it and move on.

   Whatever the status, if the result carries a non-empty `escalations` (debate
   threads that ran past 3 rounds — the engine kept debating; this is a valve,
   not an exit), surface them in the report and the deferred lens comment
   already lists them: an escalated-and-unresolved thread is a candidate to hand
   to warm debate terminals rather than re-running the engine (see the lens
   SKILL's "escalation valve").

2. **codex** — **capture `CODEX_START=$(git -C "$repoPath" rev-parse HEAD)` first** (so
   you can scope the debate's own commits for the comment table below), then invoke
   `/codex-debate` (Skill tool) as `review --repo "$repoPath"
   --base MB`, **`--no-comment`** (so it doesn't advertise its local-only round commits
   before be-review's final push — you post the codex comment after the push),
   **`--effort xhigh`** (the gauntlet's deep review), and thread both **`--context`**
   (the task / main-agent intent, so the author reasons from what you know — not just
   the diff) and **`--rationale`** (so codex doesn't flag deliberate decisions). Passing
   **`--repo`** is what keeps a **cross-repo** run correct — `/codex-debate` roots all its
   git/scratch/gh/spawn operations in that path, so a companion-repo review never
   degrades to the cwd (the wrong-repo failure Preflight guards against). **When
   the diff makes an API-facing change to the shared surface stack**
   (`packages/surface{,-app,-remote}` per `.claude/rules/surface.md`), it trips the
   drishti companion-repo gate, satisfiable **only against the *final* post-gauntlet kolu
   HEAD** — never mid-review, by construction. Seed that into `--rationale` explicitly
   (e.g. *"the surface.md drishti ship-gate is deferred to §ship; it is not a blocking
   code finding"*) so codex defers it **from round 1**. `/codex-debate` also defers such
   a gate reactively once you flag it mid-round, but the up-front rationale is what
   converges the debate *fast*: on this skill's originating `@kolu/surface` run, the
   debate without it spun 32 rounds to a weekly-usage-limit kill (131 agents, 2.69M
   tokens); the very next surface debate, with it, converged in 2 rounds.

   **Unlike the old engine, `/codex-debate` now runs inline in your turn** — it spawns a
   live codex split, debates to consensus, and **commits each round locally itself**
   (never pushing). Follow its event-driven loop to completion; there is **no background
   `Workflow` to await** and no `commentHeader`/`workDir` return — the per-round trail is
   the debate's **commits**. On **consensus**, assemble the **compact** codex comment to
   post after the final push — a header plus a one-row-per-round commit table (the detail
   is in the commit messages, not the comment). Capture the codex debate's commit range
   now (its rounds are the commits added between the SHA before this step and HEAD):

   ```bash
   workDir="$repoPath/.codex-debate"
   # $CODEX_START = the SHA captured just BEFORE invoking /codex-debate this step.
   rounds=$(git -C "$repoPath" rev-list --count "$CODEX_START"..HEAD)
   [ "$rounds" -ge 1 ] || { echo "codex debate: no debate commits — nothing to post" >&2; }
   {
     printf '## Codex ⇄ Claude debate\n\n'
     printf '✅ Consensus in %s round(s) · reviewer effort: xhigh\n\n' "$rounds"
     printf '| Round | Commit | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n'
     # BARE sha (no backticks) so GitHub autolinks each row to its commit.
     git -C "$repoPath" log --reverse --format='%h	%s' "$CODEX_START"..HEAD \
       | nl -w1 -s'	' | while IFS=$'\t' read -r n sha subj; do
           printf '| %s | %s | %s |\n' "$n" "$sha" "$subj"
         done
     # Legend: one line per finding id (the subjects reference F2/F14/… by stable id).
     printf '\n**Legend** — findings codex raised:\n\n'
     jq -rs '[.[].findings[]] | unique_by(.id) | sort_by(.id|ltrimstr("F")|tonumber)[]
             | "- **\(.id)** — \(.issue|split(". ")[0])"' "$workDir"/verdict-*.json
   } > "$workDir/comment.md"   # hold this path for the post-after-push step
   ```

   If `/codex-debate` ends in **reviewer-error** (codex broken/unavailable even after its
   own re-asks) or aborts on a **merge-base-error**, there is **no consensus and no body
   to post**: report the failure honestly (no false-consensus comment) and move on to the
   simplify step (for a merge-base-error, fix the base ref and re-run). The old
   `commit-incomplete` / `section-incomplete` reconciliation is gone — the new engine's
   author *is* the running agent, which writes each section file and commits its own round
   directly, so there is no partial-return gap to reconcile.

3. **simplify** — invoke `/simplify` (Skill tool), scoped to the change vs `MB`.
   It applies its fixes to the working tree. When it finishes, **commit** what it
   changed (`refactor: simplify <area>`, staging only the files it touched). If it
   changed nothing, note that and move on.

4. **police** — invoke `/code-police` (Skill tool), passing **`--no-elegance`
   whenever the simplify track (step 3) ran this gauntlet**. That flag skips
   Pass 3 (elegance), which would otherwise re-invoke `/simplify` over the tree
   step 3 already simplified — a full skill invocation to re-derive a
   near-guaranteed no-op. Pass 1 (rules) and Pass 2 (fact-check) still run.
   _Only omit the flag when `--tracks` excluded `simplify`_ — then no standalone
   simplify ran, and the elegance pass is the run's one simplify, not redundant.
   Its embedded pass prompts diff against
   `origin/HEAD...HEAD` by default, which is *wrong* whenever `--base` isn't the
   repo default: before invoking, **tell the police passes to scope to `MB`** —
   pass the merge-base explicitly so every pass runs `git diff <MB>...HEAD`, not
   the default ref. **Apply** the fixes it surfaces, committing each
   `fix(police): <title>` with the finding in the message (stage only the files
   changed).

## Push, then comment

First settle whether there is anything to push: `git log --oneline $START..HEAD`
(`$START` was captured in Preflight). Then:

- **Run `just fmt` before any push, whenever new commits exist.** The four
  reviewers edit and commit code but **none guarantees formatting**, and `just
  check` is tsc + biome *lint* — it never runs the formatter. So a hand-edit by
  lens/codex/police (a reflowed `.ts` closure, a `default.nix` fileset tweak that
  wants `nixpkgs-fmt`) sails through green `check` yet leaves the tree unformatted,
  and `ci::fmt` then reds in §5 and burns a whole CI cycle on a re-run (it has,
  more than once). `just fmt` runs **both** biome-format and nixpkgs-fmt, so it is
  the only gate that matches `ci::fmt`. Once the steps finish and new commits
  exist, run `just fmt` and, if it changed anything, commit the reformat (`style:
  just fmt`, staging only what it touched) so the formatted tree rides this push —
  don't leave formatting for the §5 CI loop to surface.
- **New commits exist** and **a PR exists for this branch**
  (`gh pr view --json number -q .number`) → **`git push`**. **Only after the push
  succeeds** do you post the deferred comments — the lens and codex bodies from
  steps 1–2 are now safe to publish because the SHAs they name are on the remote.
- **No new commits** (every step was clean or applied nothing) but **a PR
  exists** → there is nothing to push, and HEAD is already remote-visible, so
  post the deferred comments **immediately**. The local-only-SHA invariant is
  about never advertising an *unpushed* commit; with no new commit there is no
  such risk.
- **No PR** → there is nothing to push to and nothing to comment on. Skip both;
  the local commits (if any) and their findings live in chat and the local log
  for the human.
- **A required push fails** → do **not** post the comments (the SHAs are still
  local-only); report the push failure instead.

**Never merge** — pushing updates the open PR; the human reviews the commits and
merges when satisfied.

When you do post, post **one comment per track that produced a body** — skip any
track `--tracks` excluded, and skip a track that ran but yielded no postable
comment (lens on `merge-base-error`, codex on persistent `reviewer-error`): the
lens body and the codex body verbatim (`gh pr comment -F` — the codex body is the
`$workDir/comment.md` you assembled in step 2 as a compact commit table), and the police summary (the
`## [👮 Code-police](https://agency.srid.ca/)` comment described in Report).

## Report

Summarize in chat — reporting **only the selected tracks**, and naming any track
`--tracks` **skipped** so the absence is explicit, not silent:

- **lens** — status (**consensus** + fixes applied, or **unresolved** + how many
  findings still need human adjudication and how you adjudicated each, or
  `merge-base-error`); its PR comment landed (posted after the push) — except on
  `merge-base-error`, which has no comment body to post.
- **codex** — consensus / reviewer-error; on consensus its PR comment landed (posted
  after the push, per "Push, then comment") — on reviewer-error there is no comment to post.
- **simplify** — whether it changed anything and what it committed.
- **police** — findings and how each was actioned; the
  `## [👮 Code-police](https://agency.srid.ca/)` summary comment landed (posted
  after the push, alongside the lens and codex comments).
- whether the fixes were pushed;
- `git log --oneline <base>..HEAD` + `git diff --stat <base>` so the combined
  result is visible.
