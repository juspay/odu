# Review gauntlet (serial)

Run the reviewers **one after another** on the live branch, each the **sole
editor while it runs**. When a step starts the previous one has already
committed, so every reviewer reads a clean, settled tree and applies its own
fixes directly. Why serial, and the incidents behind the rules below:
[`RATIONALE.md`](RATIONALE.md) — read it when editing this skill, not when
running it.

1. **architecture-first-principles** — FIRST, for a diff touching framework packages
   (`@kolu/surface*`), adding/reshaping module structure, **or whose correctness
   rests on a concurrency / ordering claim** (a race declared closed, one event
   asserted to land "before" another, timing across independent async cascades, a
   flag flipped by one callback that another path reads back as truth): run the
   named checks per their SKILL (Workflow fan-out, adversarial verify, scope = diff +
   one hop down its imports). Skip ONLY for pure-docs or trivially-local diffs —
   and a diff leaning on a happens-before is **not** trivially-local
   (`RATIONALE.md`). Say so either way. Its confirmed findings are dispositioned
   like any stage's — fix now or record where, never "acceptable for scope".
2. **`/lens-debate`** — lowy and hickey review boundaries/simplicity as two
   independent parallel subagents, then one reconcile-and-apply pass commits the
   fixes (grouped by area, minors batched). Pass the change **`rationale`** so the lenses
   don't flag deliberate decisions.
3. **`/agent-debate`** — the explicitly selected Claude, Codex, or Grok peer
   debates the current author agent to consensus. Its author rounds edit and
   auto-commit `fix(…)` on the branch.
4. **`/simplify`** — the self-applying reuse / simplification / efficiency pass
   over the changed code. Now that nothing runs concurrently, it runs as itself
   (it could not against the old read-only snapshot).
5. **code-police** — its rule-checklist and fact-check passes, applying their
   fixes. Run with `--no-elegance` so its elegance pass is skipped: that pass
   re-invokes `/simplify`, which step 4 already ran over this same tree.

Each step runs to completion before the next begins.

**PR comments come after the push, never before.** Each step commits locally but
be-review pushes only once, after all selected steps finish, then posts. The
debate skills run with their self-commenting **suppressed** (`--no-comment`) and
each leaves its body on disk — the lens skill writes `.lens-debate/comment.md`;
the agent-debate body is a compact commit table you assemble in step 2. No PR
comment can reference a local-only commit.

## Preflight

- **Non-empty diff.** `git diff --stat <base>` (default: the repo default via
  `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`). If empty, stop.
- **Commit first.** Reviewers review *committed* code — commit/stash any
  outstanding work before starting (in `/be` this is automatic: §2/§3 commit and
  push before §4).
- **Verify `<base>` is a remote-tracking ref — mechanically, not by eyeballing the
  diff stat.** A caller's `--base master` names the **local** `master`, which on a
  long-lived worktree is routinely tens of commits behind origin, so the merge-base
  lands in the base branch's own past and the "diff" swells with history nobody wrote:
  one run resolved a base 40 commits stale and handed the reviewers 377 files instead
  of 9. After `git fetch origin`, run
  `git -C "$repoPath" rev-parse --verify --quiet "refs/remotes/$base"` — if it fails,
  retry once as `origin/$base` and use that; if *that* fails too, **stop and say so**
  rather than resolving a local ref. Never accept a bare branch name as given.
- **Resolve the scope once.** `git fetch origin`, then
  `MB=$(git merge-base <base> HEAD)` and `START=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`. Pass `MB`
  as the `base` to every step (their own merge-base resolution is idempotent on a
  SHA) so each reviews the change against the identical fork point. Note that each
  step sees the *commits the previous step added* as part of the diff — that is
  intended: a later reviewer reviews the earlier reviewer's fixes too. Run every
  `git` here with `git -C "$repoPath"` (below) so a cross-repo run resolves the
  *target* repo's base, not the cwd's.
- **Pin `repoPath` — the repo under review may NOT be the cwd.** A `/be` run can
  carry the work in a *companion repo* (e.g. the drishti PR a `@kolu/surface`
  change requires per `/be` §5) while the session is rooted in a kolu worktree.
  Set `repoPath` to that target repo's absolute path (default: the cwd worktree
  root) and thread it into **every** step — every subagent prompt must carry it,
  with absolute paths and `git -C "$repoPath"`, never a bare relative path
  (`RATIONALE.md` has the incident). If a cross-repo step returns `clean` against
  a non-empty *target* diff, suspect `repoPath` didn't take effect before
  trusting it.
- **Debate peer** (unless `--tracks` excludes `debate`): require
  `--agent <claude|codex|grok>` and run `/agent-debate`'s matching auth
  preflight. If it fails, name the matching login command or exact non-auth
  error and stop the gauntlet; never skip a mandatory track or select a fallback
  peer.

## Run the steps in order

`--tracks checks,lens,debate,simplify,police` selects which steps run (default all),
in the listed order. Run each to completion, then move to the next. Preflight
already ran `git fetch origin` and resolved the base, so pass `MB` straight into
each step and **skip the per-skill step-1 fetch / base resolution** — don't redo
it once per step.

**Both review steps run inline, in your own turn.** `/lens-debate` fans two lens
subagents out in one message and merges their findings in a single
reconcile-and-apply pass — no background `Workflow` to await. `/agent-debate`
drives a live selected-peer split terminal that pings you each round — follow its
event-driven loop to consensus directly. Act only on real signals (a subagent
returning, a peer ping), never a timer: **don't schedule `ScheduleWakeup` polls**
and don't babysit (a prior run wired 4-min wakeups *and* a 5-min `/loop` to nudge
a gauntlet that was simply mid-review — pure churn).

1. **lens** — follow `/lens-debate` (Skill tool). `repoPath` = the live worktree,
   `base` = `MB`, **`--no-comment`** (so it doesn't advertise its local-only
   commits before be-review pushes — defer the comment until after the push), and
   thread the `rationale` through. It commits the agreed fixes and leaves its
   rendered comment at `$repoPath/.lens-debate/comment.md` — post that file after
   the push (`gh pr comment <pr> -F …`), don't re-improvise a summary. The lens
   findings and outcome sit beside it in the same directory if you need to check
   what a lens actually said.

   `/lens-debate` returns a `status` of `clean`, `applied`, `needs-human`, or
   `merge-base-error`:
   - `clean` / `applied` — the lenses' findings settled and the fixes are
     committed.
   - `needs-human` — one or more findings sit in the skill's valve 2 (a
     judgment-shaped call, or a contradiction that hit the debate cap). `/be` §4
     requires you to **adjudicate each one yourself before moving on**: surface it
     in the report with both lenses' positions, decide drop or apply, and apply
     the survivors before continuing. Fold your adjudication into the deferred
     lens comment. Never report a `needs-human` run as settled.
   - `merge-base-error` — the scope couldn't be trusted; report it and move on.

2. **debate** — require the caller's explicit
   `--agent <claude|codex|grok>`. Capture
   `DEBATE_START=$(git -C "$repoPath" rev-parse HEAD)` first so the later
   comment includes only this debate's commits. Invoke `/agent-debate` as:

   ```text
   review --agent <selected> --repo "$repoPath" --base MB
   --no-comment --context <context> --rationale <rationale>
   ```

   Pass no reasoning-effort flag — the peer runs at its own CLI default, per
   `/agent-debate`.

   `--no-comment` defers the comment until after the final push. `--repo` keeps
   every git/scratch/gh/spawn operation rooted in a cross-repo target.
   `--context` carries the task intent to the author; `--rationale` tells the
   independent peer which decisions are deliberate.

   When an API-facing shared-surface change trips the drishti companion-repo
   gate, add this to `--rationale`: the gate is deferred to §ship because it can
   be checked only against final post-gauntlet Kolu HEAD, so it is not a
   blocking code finding. The up-front rationale prevents any selected peer from
   debating an impossible mid-review gate.

   `/agent-debate` runs inline, driving the selected peer's live split and
   committing each author round locally. On consensus, assemble the compact
   deferred comment from the debate's commit range:

   ```bash
   workDir="$repoPath/.agent-debate"
   rounds=$(find "$workDir" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'verdict-[0-9][0-9][0-9].json' | wc -l)
   commits=$(git -C "$repoPath" rev-list --count "$DEBATE_START"..HEAD)
   [ "$rounds" -ge 1 ] || { echo "agent debate: no verdicts — no completed debate" >&2; }
   authorName="<actual invoking harness name>"
   peerName="<selected peer display name>"
   {
     printf '## %s ⇄ %s debate\n\n' "$peerName" "$authorName"
     printf '✅ Consensus in %s round(s)\n\n' "$rounds"
     if [ "$commits" -gt 0 ]; then
       printf '| Fix commit | SHA | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n'
       git -C "$repoPath" log --reverse --format='%h%x09%s' "$DEBATE_START"..HEAD \
         | nl -w1 -s$'\t' | while IFS=$'\t' read -r n sha subj; do
             printf '| %s | %s | %s |\n' "$n" "$sha" "$subj"
           done
     else
       printf '_No fix commits: the peer approved after author disputes._\n'
     fi
     printf '\n**Legend** — findings %s raised:\n\n' "$peerName"
     jq -rs '[.[].findings[]] | unique_by(.id) | sort_by(.id|ltrimstr("F")|tonumber)[]
             | "- **\(.id)** — \(.issue|split(". ")[0])"' "$workDir"/verdict-*.json
   } > "$workDir/comment.md"
   ```

   Fill `authorName` from the actual running harness and normalize the selected
   peer to `Claude`, `Codex`, or `Grok`; never hardcode either side. If the
   debate ends in `reviewer-error` or `merge-base-error`, do not create or post a
   false-consensus body. Report the selected peer with the failure, then move on
   (after fixing and rerunning a bad base).

3. **simplify** — invoke `/simplify` (Skill tool), scoped to the change vs `MB`.
   It applies its fixes to the working tree. When it finishes, **commit** what it
   changed (`refactor: simplify <area>`, staging only the files it touched). If it
   changed nothing, note that and move on.

4. **police** — invoke `/code-police` (Skill tool), passing **`--no-elegance`
   whenever the simplify track (step 3) ran this gauntlet**. That flag skips
   Pass 3 (elegance), which would otherwise re-invoke `/simplify` over the tree
   step 3 already simplified — a full skill invocation to re-derive a
   near-guaranteed no-op. Pass 1 (rules) and Pass 2 (fact-check) still run.
   _Only omit the flag when `--tracks` excluded `simplify`_ — then no standalone
   simplify ran, and the elegance pass is the run's one simplify, not redundant.
   Its embedded pass prompts diff against
   `origin/HEAD...HEAD` by default, which is *wrong* whenever `--base` isn't the
   repo default: before invoking, **tell the police passes to scope to `MB`** —
   pass the merge-base explicitly so every pass runs `git diff <MB>...HEAD`, not
   the default ref. **Apply** the fixes it surfaces, committing each
   `fix(police): <title>` with the finding in the message (stage only the files
   changed).

## Push, then comment

First settle whether there is anything to push: `git log --oneline $START..HEAD`
(`$START` was captured in Preflight). Then:

- **Run `just fmt` before any push, whenever new commits exist.** No reviewer
  guarantees formatting and `just check` never runs the formatter, so an
  unformatted tree sails through a green `check` and reds `ci::fmt` later
  (`RATIONALE.md`). `just fmt` runs both biome-format and nixpkgs-fmt — the only
  gate matching `ci::fmt`. If it changed anything, commit the reformat (`style:
  just fmt`, staging only what it touched) so it rides this push.
- **New commits exist** and **a PR exists for this branch**
  (`gh pr view --json number -q .number`) → **`git push`**. **Only after the push
  succeeds** do you post the deferred comments — the lens and agent-debate bodies from
  steps 1–2 are now safe to publish because the SHAs they name are on the remote.
- **No new commits** (every step was clean or applied nothing) but **a PR
  exists** → there is nothing to push, and HEAD is already remote-visible, so
  post the deferred comments **immediately**. The local-only-SHA invariant is
  about never advertising an *unpushed* commit; with no new commit there is no
  such risk.
- **No PR** → there is nothing to push to and nothing to comment on. Skip both;
  the local commits (if any) and their findings live in chat and the local log
  for the human.
- **A required push fails** → do **not** post the comments (the SHAs are still
  local-only); report the push failure instead.

**Never merge** — pushing updates the open PR; the human reviews the commits and
merges when satisfied.

When you do post, post **one comment per track that produced a body** — skip any
track `--tracks` excluded, and skip a track that ran but yielded no postable
comment (lens on `merge-base-error`, debate on persistent `reviewer-error`): the
lens body and the agent-debate body verbatim (`gh pr comment -F` — the debate body is the
`$workDir/comment.md` you assembled in step 2 as a compact commit table), and the police summary (the
`## [👮 Code-police](https://agency.srid.ca/)` comment described in Report).

## Report

Summarize in chat — reporting **only the selected tracks**, and naming any track
`--tracks` **skipped** so the absence is explicit, not silent:

- **lens** — status (**applied** + the fixes, or **needs-human** + which findings
  needed adjudication and how you adjudicated each, or `merge-base-error`); its
  PR comment landed (posted after the push) — except on `merge-base-error`, which
  has no comment body to post.
- **debate** — selected peer + consensus / reviewer-error; on consensus its PR comment landed (posted
  after the push, per "Push, then comment") — on reviewer-error there is no comment to post.
- **simplify** — whether it changed anything and what it committed.
- **police** — findings and how each was actioned; the
  `## [👮 Code-police](https://agency.srid.ca/)` summary comment landed (posted
  after the push, alongside the lens and agent-debate comments).
- whether the fixes were pushed;
- `git log --oneline <base>..HEAD` + `git diff --stat <base>` so the combined
  result is visible.
